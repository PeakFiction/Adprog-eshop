# Reflection 1

Clean code principles as well as secure coding practices have been applied to my codes. As I have been doing ever since I started coding, I've been naming variables properly that refer to their usage and true functions, as well as writing it in a camel format, making it look and read better. And I've utilized git branches to organize the features set within the application.

1. I think unit tests are necessary when time is available. As in, when in a hurry, one must make the necessary unit tests such that at the very least the code is working properly and as it should be. Not only that but checking the necessary tests and work our way there is, what I think, the best way to do it. I.e. core features first and then secondary features, etc.

2. I believe the cleanliness of the code of the new functional test suite will need to be the same or rather, use the same name variables as the ones from before. One might say, we can reuse it, and repurpose it. Some issues might pop up such as inconsistencies with the naming conventions, or variable namings, that makes it much harder to discern the true purpose of the original code. It is of the utmost importance to think of the cleanliness of the code whenever possible.

1. Several aspects needed fixing, although none were critical. Going into detail on each might seem unnecessary. One notable issue was the presence of unnecessary imports, so we focused on tidying up the code to improve efficiency. We also simplified the system's structure to boost performance while maintaining functionality. Dealing with these issues helped things run more smoothly and boosted productivity in solving the underlying problems.

2. After examining the CI/CD workflows, I've noticed that the current setup effectively follows its intended procedures. This observation stems from the smooth execution seen whenever adjustments are made to the codebase. Specifically, when changes are initiated, the system promptly runs automated tests as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) phase. Then, it smoothly moves into the Continuous Deployment (CD) phase, deploying the updated code automatically. This coordinated workflow highlights the successful integration and operation of the CI/CD pipeline in the development setup. Overall, the seamless coordination of these procedures boosts development efficiency and guarantees swift deployment of high-quality code updates.
