# Reflection 1

Clean code principles as well as secure coding practices have been applied to my codes. As I have been doing ever since I started coding, I've been naming variables properly that refer to their usage and true functions, as well as writing it in a camel format, making it look and read better. And I've utilized git branches to organize the features set within the application.

1. I think unit tests are necessary when time is available. As in, when in a hurry, one must make the necessary unit tests such that at the very least the code is working properly and as it should be. Not only that but checking the necessary tests and work our way there is, what I think, the best way to do it. I.e. core features first and then secondary features, etc.

2. I believe the cleanliness of the code of the new functional test suite will need to be the same or rather, use the same name variables as the ones from before. One might say, we can reuse it, and repurpose it. Some issues might pop up such as inconsistencies with the naming conventions, or variable namings, that makes it much harder to discern the true purpose of the original code. It is of the utmost importance to think of the cleanliness of the code whenever possible.
